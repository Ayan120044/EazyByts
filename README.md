Portfolio CMS Full-Stack Website
A Portfolio CMS (Content Management System) Website is a dynamic platform designed to showcase personal projects, skills, experiences, and achievements. Unlike a static portfolio, it provides an admin panel where the owner can log in, add, edit, or delete portfolio items, blogs, images, and other content without modifying the source code.

The system is built using full-stack technologies, typically combining:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks like React.js or Next.js for a responsive and interactive user interface.

Backend: Node.js/Express.js or similar frameworks to handle server logic, authentication, and API endpoints.

Database: MongoDB, MySQL, or PostgreSQL for storing user data, projects, and CMS content.

Key Features:

Secure Authentication: Only the portfolio owner can manage content.

User-Friendly Admin Dashboard: Add and update portfolio items, blog posts, images, and descriptions.

Public Portfolio Page: Visitors can view projects, skills, contact details, and other showcased work.

Responsive Design: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

SEO-Friendly Structure: Helps increase online visibility.

Use Case:
Perfect for freelancers, developers, designers, or professionals who want full control over their portfolio without depending on a developer for updates.
